- Indicate resume of adjourned game in log. 
- Wild support (at least FRC).
- Make pgn standard compliant (lines < 80 chars).
- ICC does not allow setting the "interface" variable multiple times. 
  So icsdroneng cannot use this to communicate things to the user.
  Duplicate this with a finger note (this is somewhat tricky).
- Implement a version of marker.c using tells (the current version works
  well for unregistered users on FICS where tells sometimes get lost).
- Print warning if longAlgebraicMoves is false and the engine
  has not indicated it understands san ("feature san=1").


Proxy
=====

-Variable proxyHost.
-Create banner.
-Create "runData.garbage" variable to filter out more stuff.
-When proxy connects and we are in a game, send last seen board to proxy
before doing anything else.
-Filter out moves sent by xboard.
-Filter out "set interface" sent by xboard.
-Create timer which generates a prompt after (say) 200ms when there has been
ics output and icsdrone has not autogenerated a prompt for other reasons.
-Filter out "quit" on proxy. Currently it kills icsdrone!
-Allow commands issued on proxy (i.e. softquit, set commands).
-Implement login dialog.
