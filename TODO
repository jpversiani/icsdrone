Bugs
====

- icsdrone does not recognize white/black option in game start.
- There is something weird with icsdrone sometimes starting without
logging. Debug.

General
=======

- Make icsdrone remember its options under autorestart (when FICS disconnects). 
- Implement a version of marker.c using tells (the current version works
  well for unregistered users on FICS where tells sometimes get lost).
- Wild support (at least FRC).


- Indicate resume of adjourned game in log. 
- Make pgn standard compliant (lines < 80 chars).
- ICC does not allow setting the "interface" variable multiple times. 
  So icsdroneng cannot use this to communicate things to the user.
  Duplicate this with a finger note (this is somewhat tricky).
- Print warning if longAlgebraicMoves is false and the engine
  has not indicated it understands san ("feature san=1").


Proxy
=====

-Make kibitzing similar to xboard kibitzing.
-More sane opening book moves kibitzing.

-Extend "write protection" also to writing to ICS 
	(cfr "GnuCheese_restart.log").
