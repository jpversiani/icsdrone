- Indicate resume of adjourned game in log. 
- Wild support (at least FRC).
- Make pgn standard compliant (lines < 80 chars).
- ICC does not allow setting the "interface" variable multiple times. 
  So icsdroneng cannot use this to communicate things to the user.
  Duplicate this with a finger note (this is somewhat tricky).
- Implement a version of marker.c using tells (the current version works
  well for unregistered users on FICS where tells sometimes get lost).
- Print warning if longAlgebraicMoves is false and the engine
  has not indicated it understands san ("feature san=1").
