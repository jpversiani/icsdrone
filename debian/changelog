* Avoid accepting a new game when quitting. If the engine is playing with 
  noescape this would otherwise result in a lost game due to disconnection.
	
* Accept sigint=1 from engine. Needed for Rookie. 
	
* Default "This is <engine-name>" message wasn't going anywhere on FICS, 
  because "This" is not a command. Prefix it with whatever is set as 
  `feedbackCommand'.
	
* Function SetTimeZone() doesn't compile on FreeBSD. `timezone' is a function, 
  not a variable. Use `tm_gmtoff' instead.
	
* Fix bug setting timezone for UTC=0.

* Send engine stderr to engine stdout instead to /dev/null.

  * There is a small possibility that icsdroneng accepts a match request after attempting to join a tourney. In this version icsdroneng detects this and tries to withdraw from the tourney.

  * Small bugfix in timer code (confusion between msec and usec).

  * Do not send standings in current form to owner (too many tells).

  * No rematch after an adjourned or aborted game as it directed to the wrong player.

  * When running as an unregistered user feedback tells are now throttled. Of course they will arrive very slowly (just as they did before) but at least they don't get lost due to communications quota overload.

  * Do not forward draw CLAIMS to FICS. It is useless since FICS has its own means to detect legal draws. Furthermore it is actually harmful since the draw claim will likely arrive after the end of the game as far as FICS is concerned. In a tourney where the games succeed each other very quickly the draw claim may be interpreted as a draw OFFER for the next game (this really happens).

  * Bugfix: registered/unregistered detection was not correct.

  * Added option: engineQuiet. Suppress most engine actions. Some engines are too noisy.

  * Added option "ownerQuiet" to suppress owner tells about game progress. 
  * Moved up the processing of sendGameStart so that tells in it do not get queued and arrive after the opponent has moved (this is mainly a problem for computers running as guests). A tell in sendGameStart is often used to inform the opponent that the player is a computer. Thus it should arrive as quickly as possible (noticed by Eric Mullins).

  * Bugfix: Shortlog of fedora was mangled. 
  * The use of setjmp/longjmp is now compatible with the specification. 
  * Courtesy adjourn time reduced to 45 seconds. 
  * Fixed segfault which occurred when sendTimeout was set. 
  * AutoJoin is now true by default. 
  * More elaborate interface string.
