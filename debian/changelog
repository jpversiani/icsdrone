  * Bugfix: wild/8 and wild/8a were not allowing castling.
	
  * Send proper iset command to allow wildcastle.
	
  * More feedback when resigning because of technical trouble.
	
  * New option -bailoutStrategy to indicate how to handle things that
    should not happen.
	
  * Icsdrone now recognizes engine resigns like "0-1 {White resigns}".
	
  * Fix race condition in moretime handling. This was used for abuse.
	
  * The generated pgn now contains variant and FEN tags for variant/shuffle
    games. These are currently incorrect for adjourned games, but so was
    omitting them...
	
  * Throttling of opponent challenges was broken.

  * Do not give feedback on bookmoves if feedback option is not set.
	
  * Process feature draw=0.

  * Avoid accepting a new game when quitting. If the engine is playing with 
  noescape this would otherwise result in a lost game due to disconnection.
	
  * Accept sigint=1 from engine. Needed for Rookie. 
	
  * Default "This is <engine-name>" message wasn't going anywhere on FICS, 
  because "This" is not a command. Prefix it with whatever is set as 
  `feedbackCommand'.
	
  * Function SetTimeZone() doesn't compile on FreeBSD. `timezone' is a 
  function, not a variable. Use `tm_gmtoff' instead.
	
  * Fix bug setting timezone for UTC=0.

  * Send engine stderr to engine stdout instead to /dev/null.

  * Make processing of draw offers and resigns from engine stricter.

  * In PGN output give month and day with 2 digits to comply with standard (MK).

  * Send opponent name and ratings to engine (MK).

  * Allow PGN output to be piped through a command (MK).

  * Look for engine's 1/2-1/2 only at the start of the line (MK).

  * ICC port by Marcel van Kervinck!! There may be still a few glitches and 
  tournaments do not work but playing games seems to be ok!

  * When running as an unregistered user feedback tells are now throttled. Of course they will arrive very slowly (just as they did before) but at least they don't get lost due to communications quota overload.

  * Do not forward draw CLAIMS to FICS. It is useless since FICS has its own means to detect legal draws. Furthermore it is actually harmful since the draw claim will likely arrive after the end of the game as far as FICS is concerned. In a tourney where the games succeed each other very quickly the draw claim may be interpreted as a draw OFFER for the next game (this really happens).

  * Bugfix: registered/unregistered detection was not correct.

  * Added option: engineQuiet. Suppress most engine actions. Some engines are too noisy.

  * Added option "ownerQuiet" to suppress owner tells about game progress. 
  * Moved up the processing of sendGameStart so that tells in it do not get queued and arrive after the opponent has moved (this is mainly a problem for computers running as guests). A tell in sendGameStart is often used to inform the opponent that the player is a computer. Thus it should arrive as quickly as possible (noticed by Eric Mullins).
