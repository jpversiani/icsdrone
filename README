NAME
       icsdroneng -  Interface between an xboard chess engine and FICS

SYNOPSIS
       icsdrone [options]

DESCRIPTION
       icsdroneng is a fork of icsdrone.

           icsdroneng acts as an interface between FICS (the Free Internet Chess Server) and
           a chess engine supporting the XBoard/WinBoard protocol. Unlike XBoard/WinBoard
           it does not use a graphical interface so it is suitable for use on
           embedded systems.

           UCI engines may be used through the polyglot adapter.

       icsdroneng has the following new features.

           - Feedback on commands.
           - Builtin polyglot book support.
           - Feedback on the current evaluation and principal variation (through "whisper" or "kibitz").
           - "Daemon mode" (run in background).
           - PGN logging.
           - Auto reconnection in case of network problems.
           - Support for resigning on behalf of the engine.
           - Support for handling of draw offers.
           - Support for autojoining tourneys.
           - Builtin support for using timeseal.
           - Optional "shortlog". E.g. for consulting via a webbrowser.
           - Interactive console with readline support and colors.

OPTIONS
       All options take an argument. In the case of boolean options this is
       on/off.

       -icsHost (default: "freechess.org")
           Hostname of the FICS server.

       -icsPort (default: 23)
           Port of the FICS server.

       -timeseal
           Path to timeseal binary.

       -handle (default: "guest")
           Login handle.

       -password
           FICS password

       -loginScript
           Script with login data and commands.

       -owner
           Specifies a FICS handle of a user which can send tell commands to
           icsdroneng.

       -autoReconnect (default: "on")
           Autoreconnect to FICS on network failures.

       -console (default: "on")
           Start up with console enabled. The console looks somewhat nicer
           when readline support is compiled in.

       -daemonize (default: "off")
           Go into background. This implies console off.

       -feedback (default: "off")
           Send info about the eval and principal variation.

       -feedbackOnlyFinal (default: "on")
           Give feedback info only before move.

       -feedbackCommand (default "whisper")
           The command to use to send feedback to observers. Use "kibitz" if
           you want your opponent to also see the feedback.

       -ownerQuiet (default: "off")
           Send no tells to the owner about starting and finishing games.

       -engineQuiet (default: "off")
           Do no pass on most engine commands to FICS. Some engines are just
           too noisy.

       -program (default: "gnuchess")
           Command to start the engine. If the engine is an UCI engine then
           this should be an appropriate polyglot command.

       -nice
           Run the engine at lower priority.

       -searchDepth (default: 0)
           Specifies the maximum search depth for the engine. 0 means
           unlimited.

       -secPerMove (default: 0)
           Specifies the maximum time to search for the engine. 0 means
           unlimited.

       -easyMode (default: "on")
           Specifies if the engine thinks on the opponents time or not.

       -resign (default: "on")
           Specifies if icsdroneng will resign on behalf of the engine.

       -acceptDraw (default: "on")
           Specifies if icsdroneng will accept draw offers on behalf of the
           engine.

       -scoreForWhite  (default: "off")
           Specifies if the engine reports the score of white (like Crafty).
           If the engine is Crafty then icsdroneng will turn this on
           automatically.  This is important to handle resigns and draw offers
           correctly.

       -book
           Path to an opening book in polyglot format.

       -logFile (default: "<handle>.log")
           Path to the logfile. If the name ends in .gz and zlib support is
           compiled in then the logfile will be compressed.

       -logAppend (default: "off")
           Specifies if we should append to the logfile.

       -logging (default: "on")
           Specifies if logging is enabled. Note that logfiles are very large
           so on an embedded system you probably want to disable this.

       -pgnFile (default: "<handle>.pgn")
           Log games to this file.

       -pgnLogging (default: "on")
           Specifies if logging of games is enabled.

       -shortLogFile (default: "<handle>.txt")
           Log start/end of games as well as received tells to this file.

       -shortLogging (default: "on")
           Specifies if short logging is enabled.

       -sendLogin
           Commands to send at login. Multiple commands can be separated by
           \n.

       -sendGameStart (default: "say this is <enginename>")
           Commands to send at start of game. Multiple commands can be
           separated by \n.

       -sendGameEnd
           Commands to send at end of game. Multiple commands can be separated
           by \n.

       -sendTimeOut (default: "resume")
           Commands to send when idle. Multiple commands can be separated by
           \n.

       -limitRematches  (default: 0)
           After this number of rematches wait 60 seconds before accepting. 0
           means disable.

       -hardLimit (default: 0)
           After this number of rematches automatically decline the next match
           offer from the same opponent. 0 means disable.

       -issueRematch (default: "off")
           Send "rematch" at end of the game.

       -acceptOnly
           Accept only challenges from this user.

       -noplay
           Comma separated list of players to auto decline offers from (case
           sensitive). Note this is not the same as the FICS "noplay" list.

       -autoJoin (default: "on")
           Autojoin tourneys.

       -colorTell
       -colorAlert
       -colorDefault
           Some colors for use in the console when icsdroneng is compiled with
           readline support.

CONSOLE AND TELL COMMANDS, SCRIPTS
       While icsdroneng is running you can send commands to it via the console
       and if you are the owner also via "tell". In addition commands can be
       put in scripts which can be loaded or specified as a login script (with
       the command line option "-loginScript").

       If you use a login script the first two lines should be the username
       and password.

       The following commands are interpreted by icsdroneng.

           help       Give some rudimentary help
           set        Set an option (see below)
           softquit   Quit at the end of this game
           hardquit   Quit now
           restart    Quit and reconnect if autoReconnect is enabled. Otherwise quit.
           options    List the settable options
           coptions   List all options including those not settable at runtime.
           daemonize  Go into background
           load       Execute a script (for security reasons the name should end with .icsdrone)

       Other commands (e.g. "draw", "seek", "match") will be forwarded to
       FICS.  Unless they are prefixed by * in which case they will be sent to
       the engine.

       With the "set" command you can change some command line options at
       runtime.  This applies to the following options.

           easymode
           searchdepth
           secpermove
           sendgameend
           sendgamestart
           sendtimeout
           sendlogin
           limitrematches
           issuerematch
           hardlimit
           acceptonly
           feedback
           feedbackcommand
           ownerquiet
           pgnlogging
           shortlogging
           noplay
           autojoin
           autoreconnect
           resign
           acceptdraw
           scoreforwhite
           colortell
           coloralert
           colordefault

       In contrast to command line options, these options are not case
       sensitive.

ADITIONAL REMARKS
       It is important to always issue manual seeks. E.g. seek 1 0 m.  In that
       way icsdroneng can perform checks before accepting an opponent (like
       verifying the noplay option). This is especially important when playing
       as a guest since in that case FICS does not know you are a computer and
       will auto match seeks (annoying the hell out of people who do not
       expect to get a computer opponent).  icsdroneng defends against this
       but this will only work if you issue manual seeks.

EXAMPLES
       An example command line

           icsdrone -owner RoboOwner -program "polyglot engine.ini"  -loginScript engine.script -timeseal ./timeseal.Linux -book performance.bin -daemonize on

       Here is an example login script

           RoboUser
           xxxx
           set sendgameend say thanks\nseek 2 12 m
           seek 2 12 m

       A command line to make crafty play blitz without further intervention

          icsdrone -handle RoboUser -password xxx -program crafty -sendLogin "seek 2 12 m" -sendGameEnd "seek 2 12 m"

       an equivalent version

          icsdrone -handle RoboUser -password xxx -program crafty -sendLogin "seek 2 12 m\n set sendgameend seek 2 12 m"

EXIT STATUS
       icsdroneng returns 1 ("restart") if the autoReconnect option is off and
       a network error occurs after a succesful login or a restart command is
       executed.  In all other cases a value > 1 is returned.
