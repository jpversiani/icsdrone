0.03
- Initial public release of icsdroneng.
0.04
- Slight modification of configure.ac (better detection of libreadline
and zlib).
- Cygwin support.
0.05
- Correction of some typos.
- Short logging.
- More feedback in console (draw & abort requests)
0.06
- Noplay option.
- The scheduling mechanism no longer uses the alarm signal.
0.08
- New options: autoJoin, sendLogin, hardLimit, acceptDraw, autoReconnect.
0.09
- Some cleanups.
0.10
- Bugfix: End of "standings" was incorrectly detected for knockout tourney.
0.11
- Bugfix: Shortlog of fedora was mangled.
- The use of setjmp/longjmp is now compatible with the specification.
- Courtesy adjourn time reduced to 45 seconds.
- Fixed segfault which occurred when sendTimeout was set.
- AutoJoin is now true by default.
- More elaborate interface string.
0.12
- Added option "ownerQuiet" to suppress owner tells about game progress.
- Moved up the processing of sendGameStart so that tells in it
  do not get queued and arrive after the opponent has moved (this is mainly a
  problem for computers running as guests). A tell in sendGameStart is often
  used to inform the opponent that the player is a computer. Thus it should
  arrive as quickly as possible (noticed by Eric Mullins).
0.14
- When running as an unregistered user feedback tells are now throttled.
  Of course they will arrive very slowly (just as they did before) but at least
  they don't get lost due to communications quota overload.
- Do not forward draw CLAIMS to FICS. It is useless since FICS has its own
  means to detect legal draws. Furthermore it is actually harmful since the
  draw claim will likely arrive after the end of the game as far as FICS is
  concerned. In a tourney where the games succeed each other very
  quickly the draw claim may be interpreted as a draw OFFER for the
  next game (this really happens).
- Added option: feedbackCommand. Default "whisper".
- Bugfix: registered/unregistered detection was not correct.
- Added option: engineQuiet. Suppress most engine actions. Some
  engines are too noisy.
- delete_timer now sets the timer to NULL.
0.15
- Timers have now millisecond precision.
- No rematch after an adjourned or aborted game as it is directed to the wrong player.
- Elimination of a number of explicit malloc's.
0.16
- Small bugfix in timer code (confusion between msec and usec).
- Do not send standings in current form to owner (too many tells).
0.17
- Revert change of not sending draw claims to FICS. Contrary to what
  I believed FICS does not adjudicate draws by threefold repetition.
  But the race condition still remains since the opponent may claim draw
  before our own draw claim arrives at FICS.
0.18
- WIN32 portability fixes by Eric Mullins.
0.19
- There is a small possibility that icsdroneng accepts a match request
  after attempting to join a tourney. In this version icsdroneng detects
  this and tries to withdraw from the tourney.
0.20
- FICS nowrap setting (Eric Mullins)
- Correction of some memset's that had their parameters reversed.
0.21
- Option added (default true) to give only feedback before move.
0.22
- Do not join variant tourneys.
0.23
- Avoid accepting a new game when quitting. If the engine is playing with
  noescape this would otherwise result in a lost game due to disconnection.
- Accept sigint=1 from engine. Needed for Rookie (Marcel van Kervinck).
- Default "This is <engine-name>" message wasn't going anywhere on FICS,
  because "This" is not a command. Prefix it with whatever is set as
  `feedbackCommand' (MK).
- Function SetTimeZone() doesn't compile on FreeBSD. `timezone' is a function,
  not a variable. Use `tm_gmtoff' instead (MK).
- Fix bug setting timezone for UTC=0 (MK).
- Send engine stderr to engine stdout instead to /dev/null (MK).
- Process feature draw=0 (Werner MÃ¼hlpfordt).
- Do not give feedback on bookmoves if feedback option is not set.
- Make processing of draw offers and resigns from engine stricter.
- In PGN output give month and day with 2 digits to comply with standard (MK).
- Send opponent name and ratings to engine (MK).
- Allow PGN output to be piped through a command (MK).
- Look for engine's 1/2-1/2 only at the start of the line (MK).
- ICC port by Marcel van Kervinck!! There may be still a few glitches and tournaments
do not work but playing games seems to be ok!
0.25
- Act as a local proxy for the remote ICS.
- Fix for different "Creating" message for tourney at ICC (M v Kervinck).
0.26
- Enable wrapping in generated pgn file (Gautam Mani).
- Add autogen.sh.
- Transfer to sourceforge.
0.27
- Wild support.
0.28
- More careful parsing of ICS promotion suffix.
- Avoid getting stuck if mamer does not respond to the ListTourneys command.
- Documentation fixes (Eric Mullins).
0.29
- Bugfix: wild/8 and wild/8a were not allowing castling.
- Send proper iset command to allow wildcastle.
- More feedback when resigning because of technical trouble.
- New option -bailoutStrategy to indicate how to handle things that
  should not happen.
- Icsdrone now recognizes engine resigns like "0-1 {White resigns}".
- Fix race condition in moretime handling. This was used for abuse.
- The generated pgn now contains variant and FEN tags for variant/shuffle
  games. These are currently incorrect for adjourned games, but so was
  omitting them...
- Throttling of opponent challenges was broken.
